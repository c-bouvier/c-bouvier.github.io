<h4>MT180</h4>
<p class="p1"> 
I recently took part in the MT180 (Ma Thèse en 180 secondes) outreach competition for French PhD students. The aim was to  make our PhD accessible to the general public in only 3 minutes! I was one of the 18 finalists
at Sorbonne University and I won the online public prize.
The video (3 min in French) is available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOSnKtol7J4">YouTube</a>.<br></p>

<h4>Actions for women in sciences</h4>
<h5>RJMI</h5>
	<p class="p1"> I was organiser with <a href="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Aurelie.Denys/">Aurélie Denys</a>
	of the RJMI (Rendez-vous des Jeunes Mathématiciennes et Informaticiennes) of the Inria Paris centre,
	that took place in November 2021. I was also part of the speaker during speed-meetings in 2020 and 2022.<br>
	This event is aimed at young girls, in high school, who are motivated by mathematics and computer science.
	Through workshops and informal discussions with mathematicians and computer scientists, they can consider the place that these subjects can have in their studies and their future career.
	The aim is to encourage them to affirm their interest in mathematics and computer science and to develop an ambitious project for scientific studies.<br>
	See more information on the webpage of <a href="https://filles-et-maths.fr/rendez-vous-des-jeunes-mathematiciennes/">filles-et-maths</a>.</p>
	<br>

<h5>Mentoring</h5>
	<p class="p1"> 
	I am also part of the « Filles & Maths : une équation lumineuse » mentoring network.
	The aim is to build a trusting relationship with high school girls to
	encourage them to study mathematics or computer science by
	sharing our experience, giving them advice, and listening to their concerns. <br>
	I have also had the opportunity to participate in one JFMI (Journéee Filles, Maths et Info) as a speaker during a speed-meeting to explain my career for young girls in secondary school in Indre et Loire.

<h4>Other activities</h4>
<h5>General public</h5>
	<p class="p1"> 
	I regularly give presentations about cryptography, in particular to
	students in order to introduce them to the field and suggest ways to
	pursue their studies.
	For instance, I have given a presentation for the final of the 
	<a href="https://www.concours-alkindi.fr/">Alkindi Contest</a> in May 2022 and 2023
	(this is a cryptography contest for high school students), and I have met students from François Villon high school as part of the project: "1 Scientifique - 1 Classe, Chiche!".
	<br>
	I have also made a <a href="https://math.univ-angers.fr/documents/parcours/Presentation-Clemence-Bouvier.mp4">video</a> presentation of my career path for undergraduate
	students in Angers.</p>
<br>

<h5>Junior Seminar</h5>
	<p class="p1"> 
	Besides, I'm currently co-organising the
	<a href="https://www.rocq.inria.fr/semdoc/">Junior Seminar</a>
	of Inria Paris with 
	<a href="https://gaspardbb.github.io/">Gaspard Beugnot</a> and
	<a href="https://theophilec.github.io/">Théophile Cantelobre</a>.
	<br>
	It is a seminar that allows young researchers to present their work
	to members of other teams.
