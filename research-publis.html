								<p> New symmetric primitives are being designed to address a novel set of
								design criteria. Instead of being executed on regular processors or smartcards, they
								are instead intended to be run in abstract settings such as multi-party computations
								or zero-knowledge proof systems. This implies in particular that these new primitives
								are described using operations over large finite fields. As the number of such primi-
								tives grows, it is important to better understand the properties of their underlying
								operations.<br>

								In this paper, we investigate the algebraic degree of one of the first such block ciphers,
								namely MiMC. It is composed of many iterations of a simple round function, which
								consists of an addition and of a low-degree power permutation applied to the full state,
								usually $x \mapsto x^3$. We show in particular that, while the univariate degree increases
								predictably with the number of rounds, the algebraic degree (a.k.a multivariate degree)
								has a much more complex behaviour, and simply stays constant during some rounds.
								Such plateaus slightly slow down the growth of the algebraic degree.<br>

								We present a full investigation of this behaviour. First, we prove some lower and
								upper bounds for the algebraic degree of an arbitrary number of iterations of MiMC
								and of its inverse. Then, we combine theoretical arguments with simulations to prove
								that the upper bound is tight for up to 16265 rounds. Using these results, we slightly
								improve the higher-order differential attack presented at Asiacrypt 2020 to cover one
								or two more rounds. More importantly, our results provide some precise guarantees
								on the algebraic degree of this cipher, and then on the minimal complexity for a
								higher-order differential attack.</p>

								<p> Recent advanced Zero-Knowledge protocols, along with other high-level
								constructions such as Multi-Party Computations (MPC), have highlighted the need
								for a new type of symmetric primitives that are not optimized for speed on the usual
								platforms (desktop computers, servers, microcontrollers, RFID tags...), but for their
								ability to be implemented using arithmetic circuits.<br>

								Several primitives have already been proposed to satisfy this need. In order to
								enable an efficient arithmetization, they operate over large finite fields, and use round
								functions that can be modelled using low degree equations. The impact of these
								properties on their security remains to be completely assessed. In particular, algebraic
								attacks relying on polynomial root-finding become extremely relevant. Such attacks
								work by writing the cryptanalysis as systems of polynomial equations over the large
								field, and solving them with off-the-shelf tools (SageMath, NTL, Magma, ...).
								The need for further analysis of these new designs has been recently highlighted
								by the Ethereum Foundation, as it issued bounties for successful attacks against
								round-reduced versions of several of them.<br>

								In this paper, we show that the security analysis performed by the designers (or
								challenge authors) of four such primitives is too optimistic, and that it is possible to
								improve algebraic attacks using insights gathered from a careful study of the round
								function.<br>

								First, we show that univariate polynomial root-finding can be of great relevance
								in practice, as it allows us to solve many of the Ethereum Foundation’s challenges
								on Feistel–MiMC. Second, we introduce a trick to essentially shave off two full
								rounds at little to no cost for Substitution-Permutation Networks (SPN). This can
								be combined with univariate (resp. multivariate) root-finding, which allowed to
								solve some challenges for Poseidon (resp. Rescue–Prime). Finally, we also find an
								alternative way to set up a system of equations to attack Ciminion, leading to much
								faster attacks than expected by the designers. </p>

								<p> Advanced cryptographic protocols such as Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs of knowledge, widely used in cryptocurrency applications such as Zcash, Monero, Filecoin, Tezos, Topos, demand new cryptographic hash functions that are efficient not only over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$, but also over large fields of prime characteristic $\mathbb{F}_p$. This need has been acknowledged by the wider community and new so-called Arithmetization-Oriented (AO) hash functions have been proposed, e.g. MiMC-Hash, Rescue-Prime, Poseidon, Reinforced Concrete and Griffin to name a few.<br>

								In this paper we propose Anemoi: a new family of ZK-friendly permutations, that can be used to construct efficient hash functions and compression functions. The main features of these algorithms are that 1) they are designed to be efficient within multiple proof systems (e.g. Groth16, Plonk, etc.), 2) they contain dedicated functions optimised for specific applications (namely Merkle tree hashing and general purpose hashing), 3) they have highly competitive performance e.g. about a factor of 2 improvement over Poseidon and Rescue-Prime in terms of R1CS constraints, a 21%-35% Plonk constraint reduction over a highly optimized Poseidon implementation, as well as competitive native performance, running between two and three times faster than Rescue-Prime, depending on the field size.<br>

								On the theoretical side, Anemoi pushes further the frontier in understanding the design principles that are truly entailed by arithmetization-orientation. In particular, we identify and exploit a previously unknown relationship between CCZ-equivalence and arithmetization-orientation. In addition, we propose two new standalone components that can be easily reused in new designs. One is a new S-box called Flystel, based on the well-studied butterfly structure, and the second is Jive -- a new mode of operation, inspired by the ``Latin dance'' symmetric algorithms (Salsa, ChaCha and derivatives). Our design is a conservative one: it uses a very classical Substitution-Permutation Network structure, and our detailed analysis of algebraic attacks highlights can be of independent interest.</p>

									Designing symmetric-key primitives for applications in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has become important to address the issue of the ciphertext expansion. In such a context, cryptographic primitives with a low-AND-depth decryption circuit are desired. Consequently, quadratic nonlinear functions are commonly used in these primitives, including the well-known $\chi$ function over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$
							 		and the power map over a large finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.
									In this work, we study the growth of the algebraic degree for an SPN cipher over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}^m$, whose S-box is defined as the combination of a power map $x \mapsto x^{2^d+1}$ and an $\mathbb{F}_2$-linearized affine polynomial $x \mapsto c_0 + \sum_{i=1}^w c_i x^{2^{h_i}}$ where
									$c_1, \ldots, c_w \neq 0$.
									Specifically, motivated by the fact that the original coefficient grouping technique published at EUROCRYPT 2023 becomes less efficient for $w > 1$, we develop a variant technique that can efficiently work for arbitrary $w$. With this new technique to study the upper bound of the algebraic degree, we answer the following questions from a theoretic perspective:<br>
									1. can the algebraic degree increase exponentially when $w=1$?<br>
							    2. what is the influence of $w$, $d$ and $(h_1, \ldots h_w)$ on the growth of the algebraic degree?<br>
							    Based on this, we show (i) how to efficiently find $(h_1, \ldots h_w)$ to achieve the exponential growth of the algebraic degree and (ii) how to efficiently compute the upper bound of the algebraic degree for arbitrary $(h_1, \ldots h_w)$.
							  	Therefore, we expect that these results can further advance the understanding of the design and analysis of such primitives.</p>

								<p> Recently many symmetric primitives have been proposed for use in new
									contexts, such as Multi-Party Computation or Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Our
									aim is to investigate the security of MiMC against higher-order differential
									attacks for which the complexity decreases with the multivariate degree. MiMC
									consists of many iterations of a simple round function: the addition of a key and
									round constants and a low-degree power permutation of $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$, where $n \approx 129$.<br>
									In light of previous work, we carefully study families of exponents appearing or not
									in the univariate polynomial representation of the block cipher. For instance,
									we show that for Gold function $x \mapsto x^d$, with $d = 2^j + 1$, the exponents are
									necessary equal to 0 or 1 modulo $2^j$ , leading to very sparse polynomials for large
									j. This observation then allows us to propose a more theoretical analysis of
									the multivariate degree. Overall, we provide a detailed comparison of different
									instances of MiMC and show that at least one fourth of the exponents never
									appear in the univariate representation of the cipher. </p>

									In this talk, we present a family of hash functions: Anemoi, exploiting a link, previously
									unknown, between AO primitives and CCZ-equivalence. One of the main features that

									performance for implementation in Plonk constraints (up to 29% constraint reduction in
									standard Plonk over the most efficient existing primitive Griffin and 28%-48% over a
									highly optimized Poseidon implementation with custom gates) as well as competitivenative performance, running between two and three times faster than Rescue–Prime,
									depending on the field size.<br>

									the Flystel S-box, resp. the Open Flystel and the Closed Flystel, leads to competitive
									performance and high security in ZK applications. As to the Jive mode of operation, it is
									designed specifically for application in Merkle trees, where it offers significant improvement
									in performance. As the name suggests, it is inspired by the “Latin dance” symmetric

								<p> It is shown how bounds on exponential sums derived from modern algebraic geometry, and l-adic cohomology specifically, 
									can be used to upper bound the absolute correlations of linear approximations for cryptographic constructions of low algebraic degree. 
									This is illustrated by applying results of Deligne, Denef and Loeser, and Rojas-León, to obtain correlation bounds for a generalization 
									of the Butterfly construction, three-round Feistel ciphers, and a generalization of the Flystel construction. 
									For each of these constructions, bounds obtained using other methods are significantly weaker. In the case of the Flystel construction, 
									our bounds resolve a conjecture by the designers. <br>
									Correlation bounds of this type are relevant for the development of security arguments against linear cryptanalysis, especially in the 
									weak-key setting or for primitives that do not involve a key. Since the methods used in this paper are applicable to constructions defined 
									over arbitrary finite fields, the results are also relevant for arithmetization-oriented primitives such as Anemoi, which uses S-boxes

								In recent years, new symmetric cryptographic primitives have been proposed for advanced protocols, like multi-party computation, in combination with a fully homomorphic encryption or in various systems of zero-knowledge proofs. Such protocols are parts of a context marked by the development of cloud and blockchain technologies, and must therefore respond to the growing security concerns of users. <br>
								These protocols have put forward the need to minimize the number of multiplications performed by the primitive in large finite fields.
								Classical symmetric algorithms are then inappropriate in this context and the new cryptographic protocols must be combined with symmetric primitives (encryption or hash function) with particular properties. <br>
								While the number of designs defined over large fields, called “arithmetization-oriented”, is increasing significantly, few cryptanalysis works have been proposed. 
								The first aim of this manuscript is then to contribute to fill this gap, and hence to better understand the specificities of these new objects. We also propose a new vision to design such primitives, covering both aspects of cryptology, the cryptography and the cryptanalysis. </p>
